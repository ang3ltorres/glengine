merge sprite and drawable into a single class sprite

create a similar system for 3d -> 
texture -> sprite
mesh -> model

Perfect for PS1-style Graphics

Since you said:

"I’m writing a 2D/3D game engine with PSX graphics look"

You will probably add:

✓ Affine texture warping
✓ 16-bit LUT lighting
✓ Vertex-skinning clipping quirks
✓ No subpixel correction (to get PS1 wobble)
✓ Integer-based viewport transform
✓ Limited FOV (usually ~50–60°)
